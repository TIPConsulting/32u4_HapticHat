## Design

This is a fairly simple sensory augmentation device converts what are usually visual signals to touch and sound.  The buzzer noises increase in frequency as you get closer to obstacles around you, and the vibrator engages if you are less than a foot away.  Wearers will be able to feel their proximity to the world around them and avoid crashing into it.

## Applications

The primary application is for blind users to help navigate unfamiliar places.  This hat is most suited for people, but it would be possible to adapt it for animals as well so they can enjoy greater freedom and mobility.  It can also be used by drunkards stumbling back home, very tall people trying to avoid doorways, and anyone looking to add a bit of excitement to their rainy-day hikes.
